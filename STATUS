* lexical and package-scoped scalars
* simple blocks
* numeric literals 0x, 0b, 0d, 0o, numbers w/underscores
* string to numeric conversion

Compiler to-do
--------------
* interpolated quotes
* generalized quotes

Parser implemented
------------------
* Common while, unless statements
* Basic blocks
* Perl 6 comments (including POD, long dot)
* List associative operators

* POD comments

Parser to-do
------------
* fix long-dot comments to new S02 syntax
* fix parsing of if-block

* generalized quotes
* real pointy subs
* subroutine definitions
* subroutine calling syntax
* variables
* "use" statement
