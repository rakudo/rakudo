New in 2015.10:
 + Features
    + We are now officially in beta!
    + There is now an infix:<.> operator that does method calls with slightly
      looser precedence than the postfix unary method call.
    + Definite return values are now allowed, and force final statement to sink
    + Types with type smilies (like 'Int:D' and 'Int:U') are now first class,
      and supported in constraints for variables, for example
    + New pragmata 'use variables :D', 'use attributes :D' for defaulting type
      constraints to ':D'
    + The 'constant' declarator now supports syntactic constructs, so you can
      alias with 'my constant &infix:<plus> := &infix:<+>;'
    + New operator 'infix o' for function composition
    + New method 'produce' for triangle reduce
    + 'fc' for Unicode-correct case folding implemented
    + '<?same>' assertion in regexes implemented

       declaration

    + first now accepts :k, :v, :p attributes

      that shift or scale the end points while maintaining exclusions
    + 'is rw' now only works on scalars (was a noop), and actually requires
      a writable container. Parameters of the form '\x' enable the old
      behavior
    + The v notation now allows alphabetic components: v1.2.beta.  (Incompatible
      because method calls on a version must be protected by \ or () now.)
    + 'use v6b+;' notation is now recognized and enforced
    + Many list functions no longer flatten, or use one-arg flattening only
    + The sequence operator no longer flattens sublists, so you must use slip

      anymore
    + 'Str.tc' now does an actual Unicode title case operation
    + polymod had not been GLRified yet
