      [1331ffdd][c4c4ba98]

New in 2020.11:

  + Additions:
    + Introduce new coertion semantics. It includes coercions being first-class
      type objects, a parameter being marked as `coercive` if its type is a coerce,
      coercions redelegating method calls to their target type, coercions type checking
      being more correct. Coercions are now nominalizable, they nominalize into
      the target type. Aside from those changes, coercion protocol is introduced.
      If `coerce` method of `Metamodel::CoercionHOW` is used for `Foo(Bar)`,
      then the following methods are tried in the order of mentioning:
      - the current standard of `Bar.Foo`
      - `Bar.COERCE-INTO(Foo)`
      - `Foo.COERCE-FROM(Bar)`
      Also, nested coercions are supported now.
      User code that depends heavily on compiler internals in this area can become incompatible,
      so upgrade with caution if there is any of such sort.

New in 2020.06:
  + SPECIAL NOTES:
    + Results of `dir` routine called with dirty base path are presented
      as cleaned up for some paths (like `///` or `a/../a`) unlike
      before. While compatibility with most of other cases is preserved
      and no ecosystem fallout was observed, be cautious of the possible
      observable changes if the code does not clean dirty paths using `cleanup` method.
    + Since this release, when you start Raku with "-" as a single positional parameter, it
      will now check if STDIN is connected to a terminal.  If it is, then
      the REPL will be started, rather than appearing to freeze waiting
      for the user to enter something and issue an EOF.  If STDIN is *not*
      connected to a terminal, then Raku will read from STDIN and process
      that as the source of a program.
    + The `run` routine, `Proc.spawn` and `Proc::Async.new` are
      extended with a new argument `:$win-verbatim-args` defaulting to
      `False`. If the argument is left off or set to False, the
      arguments are quoted according to the Microsoft convention. This
      is identical to Rakus previous behavior and thus backwards
      compatible. When passing True the passed arguments are
      concatenated with a single space. No other processing takes
      place. This allows to manually quote the arguments as necessary.
  + Changes:
    + Support verbatim argument handling for `Proc` [709941c6][9a75738f]
    + Signatures of `slurp` and `spurt` routines not accepting redundant arguments is
      now compile time error rather than run-time one [22f43444]

     \
      More specifically:
      + Refactored Scalar and numerous container operations, resulting
          in Scalar being one attribute smaller and paving the way for
          a range of new optimizations
      + As part of the Scalar changes, also extensively refactored
          auto-vivification to be cheaper and more optimizable
      + Implemented specializer plugin for type-check elimination for
          assignments
      + Refactored the way return value handling is done, to generate a
          shorter code sequence
      + Improved the code generated for signature binding so as not to
          repeatedly decontainerize passed values, but rather to only do
          this once
      + Avoided a number of exceptions that could be thrown and caught in
          the optimizer, for a small performance win
      + Avoided a number of situations where parts of the compiler were
          repossessed for serialization purposes, resulting in smaller
          precompilation output
      + Tuned Map and Hash for better lookup and assignment
          performance, as well as more compact code in numerous other
          operations; this made it possible for single-element hash
          access to be fully inlined
      + Tuned Array.AT-POS to enable it to be fully inlined
      + Tuned Array.ASSIGN-POS to do less work
      + Improved `p6bindattrinvres` code-gen quality, which is a slight
          improvement for the many places in CORE.setting that use it
      + Made sure references to the Scalar type-objects compile into a
          constant, not a lexical lookup
  + Internal:
    + Implemented `Perl6::World.lang-ver-before` for easier language
        version check [4dcf5929]

        operators [46e7640f]
    + Simplified `Hash` → `Map` coercion [c567af73]
    + `PseudoStash` "pseudoers" hash is now a native hash [8a8ce95e]
    + Various `Range` internal changes [6ad096c8][806752fb]
    + Tightened up some `trait_mod:<is>` signatures [f6209d73]
    + Renamed nqp::getstrfromname to nqp::strfromname [4522132d]

New in 2015.10:

      looser precedence than the postfix unary method call.
    + Definite return values are now allowed, and force final statement to sink
    + Types with type smilies (like 'Int:D' and 'Int:U') are now first class,
      and supported in constraints for variables, for example
    + New pragmata 'use variables :D', 'use attributes :D' for defaulting type
      constraints to ':D'
