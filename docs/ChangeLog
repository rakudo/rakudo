     \
      More specifically:
      + Refactored Scalar and numerous container operations, resulting
          in Scalar being one attribute smaller and paving the way for
          a range of new optimizations
      + As part of the Scalar changes, also extensively refactored
          auto-vivification to be cheaper and more optimizable
      + Implemented specializer plugin for type-check elimination for
          assignments
      + Refactored the way return value handling is done, to generate a
          shorter code sequence
      + Improved the code generated for signature binding so as not to
          repeatedly decontainerize passed values, but rather to only do
          this once
      + Avoided a number of exceptions that could be thrown and caught in
          the optimizer, for a small performance win
      + Avoided a number of situations where parts of the compiler were
          repossessed for serialization purposes, resulting in smaller
          precompilation output
      + Tuned Map and Hash for better lookup and assignment
          performance, as well as more compact code in numerous other
          operations; this made it possible for single-element hash
          access to be fully inlined
      + Tuned Array.AT-POS to enable it to be fully inlined
      + Tuned Array.ASSIGN-POS to do less work
      + Improved `p6bindattrinvres` code-gen quality, which is a slight
          improvement for the many places in CORE.setting that use it
      + Made sure references to the Scalar type-objects compile into a
          constant, not a lexical lookup
  + Internal:
    + Implemented `Perl6::World.lang-ver-before` for easier language
        version check [4dcf5929]

        operators [46e7640f]
    + Simplified `Hash` ‚Üí `Map` coercion [c567af73]
    + `PseudoStash` "pseudoers" hash is now a native hash [8a8ce95e]

    + Tightened up some `trait_mod:<is>` signatures [f6209d73]
