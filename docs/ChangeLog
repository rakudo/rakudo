New in 2015.10:
 + Features
    + We are now officially in beta!
    + There is now an infix:<.> operator that does method calls with slightly
      looser precedence than the postfix unary method call.
    + Definite return values are now allowed, and force final statement to sink
    + Types with type smilies (like 'Int:D' and 'Int:U') are now first class,
      and supported in constraints for variables, for example
    + New pragmata 'use variables :D', 'use attributes :D' for defaulting type
      constraints to ':D'
    + The 'constant' declarator now supports syntactic constructs, so you can
      alias with 'my constant &infix:<plus> := &infix:<+>;'
    + New operator 'infix o' for function composition
    + New method 'produce' for triangle reduce
    + 'fc' for Unicode-correct case folding implemented
    + '<?same>' assertion in regexes implemented
    + Methods 'file' and 'line' in 'Code' point to the location of the
       declaration
    + grep now accepts :k, :v, :kv, :p attributes
    + first now accepts :k, :v, :p attributes
    + first also accepts :end attribute to indicate searching from end of list
    + 'is equiv<+>' as shortcut for 'is equiv(&infix:<+>)'. Same for 'tighter'
       and 'looser'.
    + 'Supply.throttle' for rate-limiting
    + 'Hash.append' added, now that Hash.push doesn't flatten
    + Internal methods ZEN-POS/ZEN-KEY added, for handling zen-slices
    + Promise.start now passes on any extra parameters to async block
    + Use of comma in sink context now distributes sink to its parts
    + Attribute containers may now have defaults
    + The new .self method is the identity method on anything
    + Negative integers are now allowed in the parameter slot
  + Incompatible Changes
    + Array.push is now used for pushing one element (mostly); Array.append
      exists for pushing multiple values. Same for 'unshift'/'prepend'
    + Basic arithmetic operations ('+', '*', '-', '/') on Range objects
      that shift or scale the end points while maintaining exclusions
    + 'is rw' now only works on scalars (was a noop), and actually requires
      a writable container. Parameters of the form '\x' enable the old
      behavior
    + The v notation now allows alphabetic components: v1.2.beta.  (Incompatible
      because method calls on a version must be protected by \ or () now.)
    + 'use v6b+;' notation is now recognized and enforced
    + Many list functions no longer flatten, or use one-arg flattening only
    + The sequence operator no longer flattens sublists, so you must use slip
      to get that effect
    + The precedence of infix:<.=> is now tighter to match new infix:<.>
    + Smartmatch with List now recursively uses smartmatch
    + Smartmatch with list now globs using '**' rather than '*'
    + callwith/nextwith no longer flatten
 + Speedups:
    + Many built-in methods that return iterables are now much faster
    + 'Bag' and 'Mix' are now faster
    + Rat addition/subtraction is now faster due to lazy reduction when
      consistent denominators are used ("cents stay cents")
 + Fixes:
    + Better error messages when comparing version strings with numbers
    + Several error messages that were lacking line numbers now include them
    + Anonymous types now compare correctly under 'infix:<===>'
    + Fixed 'once' block semantics (RT #126293)
    + A dying 'LEAVE' block doesn't prevent other 'LEAVE' blocks from running
      anymore
    + 'Str.tc' now does an actual Unicode title case operation
    + polymod had not been GLRified yet
    + List/Supply.squish did not properly handle single element lists/supplies
    + Several fixes to the REPL, e.g. with regards to completions
    + with/without now topicalize properly
    + Fix usage of match variable in replacement part of substitution
    + ».[1;1] (hyper on multidim subscript) now works
    + Methods map, push, pop, shift, unshift, append, prepend now properly
      marked as nodal
    + Attempt to smartmatch with S/// now warns
    + grep { /foo/ } now dwims again
    + Operator names now canonicalize internally to legal Perl names
    + Reduction ops now generalize to N-ary functions
    + Extra list comma is now allowed before any statement modifier
