Announce: Rakudo Perl development release #14 ("Vienna") 

On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm please to announce
the February 2009 development release of Rakudo Perl #14 "Vienna".  
Rakudo is an implementation of Perl 6 on the Parrot Virtual Machine.
The tarball for the February 2009 release is available from

    http://www.pmichaud.com/perl6/rakudo-2009-02.tar.gz

However, because of the rapid pace of Rakudo development and
addition of new features, we still recommend that people wanting
to use or work with Rakudo obtain the latest version directly
from the main repository at github -- more on this in a bit.

This is the fourteenth development release of Rakudo Perl 
(thus the #14), but it's the first release independent from Parrot
releases.  We will continue to follow a monthly release cycle, with 
each release to be code named after a Perl Mongers group.  This release
is named for the Vienna.pm (http://vienna.pm.org), who have been
sponsoring Jonathan Worthington's work on Rakudo since April 2008.
A list of the other planned release dates and codenames for 2009 is 
available in the "docs/release_guide.pod" file.  In general, Rakudo
development releases are scheduled to occur two days after each 
Parrot monthly release.

As mentioned earlier, Rakudo Perl has switched to using "git" and
github.com for its version control system.  The main repository
page is http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo ; the README file there
is kept up-to-date with the latest instructions for obtaining
and building Rakudo Perl.

In this release of Rakudo Perl, we've made the following major
changes and improvements:

* Rakudo is now passing 7076 spectests; this is an increase 
  of 796 additional passing tests since the January 2009 release.

* The Configure.pl script supports a "--gen-parrot" option to
  automatically fetch and build the appropriate version of Parrot.

* The default make target now builds a binary executable directly
  ("perl6" or "perl6.exe").  Yes, it's still a Parrot "fakecutable", 
  but we think we've made it more reliable so that it doesn't
  generate segmentation faults on exits.  (If you don't know
  what a "fakecutable" is you can safely ignore this.)

* Many builtins are beginning to be written in pure Perl 6, or
  Perl 6 functions with inline PIR.  These builtins are part of
  the core "setting" for Perl 6, and appear in the src/setting/
  directory.  Previously this was known as the "prelude".

* Improved Test.pm diagnostic output.

Also, Rakudo now implements the following Perl 6 features:

* Anonymous classes may be specified using ::
* Existing parameterized roles are now reused instead of creating new ones
* Roles pun a class when .new is invoked on them
* "proto" now marks all same-named routines as "multi".
* XopX is now Xop.
* <-> (rw) pointy blocks.
* min= and max= metaoperators.
* Many many bugfixes and documentation improvements.

The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors
for making Rakudo Perl possible.  The next release of Rakudo (#15)
is scheduled for March 19, 2009.
