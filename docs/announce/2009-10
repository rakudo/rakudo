Announce: Rakudo Perl 6 development release #22 ("Thousand Oaks")

On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm pleased to announce
the October 2009 development release of Rakudo Perl #22 "Thousand Oaks".
Rakudo is an implementation of Perl 6 on the Parrot Virtual Machine [1].
The tarball for the October 2009 release is available from
http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads .

Due to the continued rapid pace of Rakudo development and the frequent
addition of new Perl 6 features and bugfixes, we recommend building Rakudo
from the latest source, available from the main repository at github.
More details are available at http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo.

Rakudo Perl follows a monthly release cycle, with each release code named
after a Perl Mongers group. October 2009 is code named "Thousand Oaks" for the
their amazing Perl 6 hackathon, and their report at
http://www.lowlevelmanager.com/2009/09/perl-6-hackathon.html .

Since the 2009-08 release, Rakudo Perl builds from an "installed
Parrot" instead of using Parrot's build tree.  This release of Rakudo
requires Parrot 1.7.0.  For the latest information on building and
using Rakudo Perl, see the README file section titled "Building and
invoking Rakudo".  (Quick note: the "--gen-parrot" option still
automatically downloads and builds Parrot as before, if you prefer
that approach.)

Also, unlike previous versions of Rakudo Perl, the "perl6"
(or "perl6.exe") executables only work when invoked from the
Rakudo root directory until a "make install" is performed.
Running "make install" will install Rakudo and its libraries
into the Parrot installation that was used to build it, and then
the executables will work when invoked from any directory.

For this release we focused on a new signature binder which makes
calling routines and operators much faster,a and allows binding of
positional arguments by name.

Some of the specific major changes and improvements occuring
with this release include:
  
* Rakudo is now passing XX,XXX spectests, an increase of XX,XXX
  passing tests since the September 2009 release.  With this release
  Rakudo is now passing XX.X% of the available spectest suite.

* Rakudo now supports accessing outer lexical variables from classes and
  packages.

* Complex numbers are now implemented as a Perl 6 class, and supports all
  trigonometric functions from the specification.

* Some new variants of the series operator are now implemented.

The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for
making Rakudo Perl possible.  If you would like to contribute,
see http://rakudo.org/how-to-help , ask on the perl6-compiler@perl.org
mailing list, or ask on IRC #perl6 on freenode.

The next release of Rakudo (#23) is scheduled for November 19, 2009.
A list of the other planned release dates and codenames for 2009 is
available in the "docs/release_guide.pod" file.  In general, Rakudo
development releases are scheduled to occur two days after each
Parrot monthly release.  Parrot releases the third Tuesday of each month.

Have fun!
