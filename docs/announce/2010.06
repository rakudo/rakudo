    Announce: Rakudo Perl 6 development release #30 ("Kiev")

On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm pleased to announce the
June 2010 development release of Rakudo Perl #30 "Kiev".
Rakudo is an implementation of Perl 6 on the Parrot Virtual Machine
(see <http://www.parrot.org>). The tarball for the June 2010 release
is available from <http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads>.

Rakudo Perl follows a monthly release cycle, with each release named
after a Perl Mongers group. This release is named after the Perl Mongers
from the beautiful Ukrainian capital, Kiev. They recently helped organize and
participated in the Perl Mova + YAPC::Russia conference, the хакмит (hackathon)
of which was a particular success for Rakudo. All those who joined the Rakudo
hacking - from Kiev and further afield - contributed spec tests as well as
patches to Rakudo, allowing various RT tickets to be closed, and making this
month's release better. Дякую!

Some of the specific changes and improvements occurring with this
release include:

* Rakudo now uses immutable iterators internally, and generally hides
  their existence from programmers. Many more things are now evaluated
  lazily.

* Backtraces no longer report routines from Parrot internals. This used to
  be the case in the Rakudo alpha branch as well, but this time they are
  also very pleasant to look at.

* Match objects now act like real hashes and arrays.

* Regexes can now interpolate variables.

* Hash and array slicing has been improved.

* The REPL shell now prints results, even when not explicitly asked to print
  them, thus respecting the "P" part of "REPL".

* Rakudo now passes 33,378 spectests. We estimate that there are about
  39,900 tests in the test suite, so Rakudo passes about 83% of all tests.

For a more detailed list of changes see "docs/ChangeLog".

The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for
making Rakudo Perl possible, as well as those people who worked on parrot, the
Perl 6 test suite and the specification.

The next release of Rakudo (#31) is scheduled for July 22, 2010.
A list of the other planned release dates and code names for 2010 is
available in the "docs/release_guide.pod" file.  In general, Rakudo
development releases are scheduled to occur two days after each
Parrot monthly release.  Parrot releases the third Tuesday of each month.

Have fun!
