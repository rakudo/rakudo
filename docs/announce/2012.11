    Announce: Rakudo Perl 6 compiler development release #58 ("Walnut")

On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm thrilled to announce the
November 2012 release of Rakudo Perl #58 "Walnut". Rakudo is an
implementation of Perl 6 on the Parrot Virtual Machine (see
<http://www.parrot.org>). The tarball for this release
is available from <http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads>.

Please note: This announcement is not for the Rakudo Star
distribution[*] -- it's announcing a new release of the compiler only.
For the latest Rakudo Star release, see
<http://github.com/rakudo/star/downloads>.

The Rakudo Perl compiler follows a monthly release cycle, with each release
named after a Perl Mongers group. The November 2012 release is code-named
after Walnut, home of "Yet Another Society" aka "The Perl Foundation".

This release brings changes; some of them are outlined below:

+ implemented precedence related traits (equiv, looser, tighter, assoc)
+ Perl 6 grammar NFAs are pre-computed, saving some work on each invocation; this
  shaved around 10% off the time needed to run the spectests
+ regexes and quotes have better support for user-selected delimiters
+ heredocs
+ FIRST/NEXT/LAST can now be used in all types of loop (previously limited to for)

This is only a small peek at the changes in this release. For a more
detailed list, see "docs/ChangeLog".

The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for
making Rakudo Perl possible, as well as those people who worked on
Parrot, the Perl 6 test suite and the specification.

The following people contributed to this release:

Jonathan Worthington, Moritz Lenz, Carl Mï¿½sak, Jonathan Scott Duff,
Will "Coke" Coleda, Tobias Leich, Geoffrey Broadwell, Nicholas Clark,
Konrad Borowski, flussence

If you would like to contribute, see <http://rakudo.org/how-to-help>,
ask on the perl6-compiler@perl.org mailing list, or ask on IRC #perl6
on freenode.

The next release of Rakudo (#59) is scheduled for December 20, 2012. A
list of the other planned release dates and code names for future
releases is available in the "docs/release_guide.pod" file. In general,
Rakudo development releases are scheduled to occur soon after each Parrot
monthly release. Parrot releases the third Tuesday of each month.

On behalf of the development team, I encourage you to try the new release,
to live life to its fullest, to cherish each moment, and to have fun.

[*] What's the difference between the Rakudo compiler and the Rakudo
    Star distribution?

    The Rakudo compiler is a compiler for the Perl 6 language.
    Nothing else.

    The Rakudo Star distribution is the Rakudo compiler plus a selection
    of useful Perl 6 modules, the most recent incarnation of the "Using
    Perl 6" book, and other software that can be used with the Rakudo
    compiler to enhance its utility.  Rakudo Star is meant for early
    adopters who wish to explore what's possible with Rakudo Perl 6 and
    provide feedback on what works, what doesn't, and what else they
    would like to see included in the distribution.
