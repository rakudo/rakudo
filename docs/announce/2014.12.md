# Announce: Rakudo Perl 6 compiler, Development Release #83 ("Cologne")

On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm happy to announce the
December 2014 release of Rakudo Perl 6 #83 "Cologne". Rakudo is an
implementation of Perl 6 on the Moar Virtual Machine[^1], the Java Virtual
Machine and the Parrot Virtual Machine. The tarball for this release
is available from <http://rakudo.org/downloads/rakudo/>.

Please note: This announcement is not for the Rakudo Star
distribution[^2] --- it's announcing a new release of the compiler
only. For the latest Rakudo Star release, see
<http://rakudo.org/downloads/star/>.

The Rakudo Perl compiler follows a monthly release cycle, with each
release named after a Perl Mongers group. This release is named after
Cologne, in honour of the organizers of the Niederrhein.PM meeting this week.

Some of the changes in this release are outlined below:

These are only some of the changes in this release. For a more
detailed list, see "docs/ChangeLog".

+ Method FALLBACK implemented
+ Updated List smart-matching to latest design

+ Many optimizations, bug-fixes and other additions

The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for

[^2]: What's the difference between the Rakudo compiler and the Rakudo
Star distribution?

The Rakudo compiler is a compiler for the Perl 6 language.
Nothing else.

The Rakudo Star distribution is the Rakudo compiler plus a selection
of useful Perl 6 modules, a module installer, the most recent
incarnation of the "Using Perl 6" book, and other software that can
be used with the Rakudo compiler to enhance its utility.  Rakudo Star
is meant for early adopters who wish to explore what's possible with
Rakudo Perl 6 and provide feedback on what works, what doesn't, and
what else they would like to see included in the distribution.
