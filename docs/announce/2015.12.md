# Announce: Rakudo Perl 6 compiler, Development Release #94 (“коледа”)

On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I’m proud to announce the
Christmas release (December 2015) of Rakudo Perl 6 #94 “коледа”. Rakudo
is an implementation of Perl 6 on the Moar Virtual Machine[^1] and the
Java Virtual Machine.

This is the Christmas release of Rakudo Perl 6. This version of the compiler
targets the v6.c “Christmas” specification of the Perl 6 language.

The tag for this release is “коледа”, a slavic word for an ancient winter
festival that has been incorporated into Christmas. We hope you join us
in our celebration of getting our Christmas release shipped!

While we are extremely happy to ship an official Perl 6 release, this is not
the end of Rakudo’s development. We will continue to ship monthly releases,
which will continue to improve performance and our user’s experience. We’ll
also continue our work on the specification, with feedback from the community.

The tarball for this release is available from <http://rakudo.org/downloads/rakudo/>.

Please note: This announcement is not for the Rakudo Star
distribution[^2] --- it’s announcing a new release of the compiler
only. For the latest Rakudo Star release, see
<http://rakudo.org/downloads/star/>.

The Rakudo Perl compiler follows a monthly release cycle, with each
release named after a Perl Mongers group. This month’s release is named after
the Bend chapter, because we’re nearly around the bend with the upcoming
Christmas release.

Some of the changes in this release are outlined below:

New in 2015.11:
   + Initial shaped array support
   + \r\n (Carriage Return/LineFeed) is now a single (synthetic) grapheme
   + Unicode support adheres to Unicode Annex #29
   + Unicode quotes are now also allowed in regular expressions
   + Improved newline support with "use newline" and updates to IO::Handle
   + Added List.head, List.tail, List.repeated methods
   + Str.encode now allows :replacement parameter for unencodable sequences
   + Str.split now accepts multiple strings to split on
   + New Range.int-bounds returns first/last value for integer ranges
   + Auto-generated meta-ops vivified by referring to them, instead of executing
   + Illegal assignment of different Numeric values now caught at compile time
   + &nextcallee implemented, which returns the routine that nextsame would invoke
   + Many speedups

These are only some of the changes in this release. For a more
detailed list, see “docs/ChangeLog”.

The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for
making Rakudo Perl possible, as well as those people who worked on
the design docs, the Perl 6 test suite, MoarVM and the specification.

The following people contributed to this release:

Jonathan Worthington, Elizabeth Mattijsen, Larry Wall, Pawel Murias, Will "Coke" Coleda, Christian Bartolomäus, Pepe Schwarz, Timo Paulssen, Tobias Leich, Mike Francis, Nicholas Clark, Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker, Moritz Lenz, Steve Mynott, Jens Rehsack, cygx, Stefan Seifert, Jimmy Zhuo, Nick Logan, Lucas Buchala, Zoffix Znet, Donald Hunter, Lloyd Fournier, Ronald Schmidt, Bart Wiegmans, Tomasz Konojacki, Sterling Hanenkamp, Vladimir Lettiev, Faye Niemeyer, johnspurr, Tim Smith, Rob Hoelz, grondilu

If you would like to contribute or find out more information, visit
<http://perl6.org>, <http://rakudo.org/how-to-help>, ask on the
<perl6-compiler@perl.org> mailing list, or ask on IRC #perl6 on freenode.

The next release of Rakudo (#94), is tentatively scheduled for 17 December 2015.
Because that release will correspond with the Perl 6 Christmas version of
the specification, we may end up delaying the release to insure the
best possible release, but we will release by the 25th at the latest.

A list of the other planned release dates and code names for future
releases is available in the “docs/release_guide.pod” file.

The development team appreciates feedback! If you’re using Rakudo, do
get back to us. Questions, comments, suggestions for improvements, cool
discoveries, incredible hacks, or any other feedback -- get in touch with
us through (the above-mentioned) mailing list or IRC channel. Enjoy!

[^2]: What’s the difference between the Rakudo compiler and the Rakudo
Star distribution?

The Rakudo compiler is a compiler for the Perl 6 language.
Not much more.

The Rakudo Star distribution is the Rakudo compiler plus a selection
of useful Perl 6 modules, a module installer, the most recent
incarnation of the “Using Perl 6” book, and other software that can
be used with the Rakudo compiler to enhance its utility. Rakudo Star
is meant for early adopters who wish to explore what’s possible with
Rakudo Perl 6 and provide feedback on what works, what doesn’t, and
what else they would like to see included in the distribution.
