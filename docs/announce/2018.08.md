# Announce: Rakudo Perl 6 compiler, Release #125 (2018.08)

On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I’m very happy to announce the
August 2018 release of Rakudo Perl 6 #125. Rakudo is an implementation of
Perl 6 on the Moar Virtual Machine[^1].

This release implements the 6.c version of the Perl 6 specifications.
It includes bugfixes and optimizations on top of
the 2015.12 release of Rakudo.

Upcoming releases in 2018 will include new functionality that is not
part of the 6.c specification, available with a lexically scoped
pragma. Our goal is to ensure that anything that is tested as part of the
6.c specification will continue to work unchanged. There may be incremental
spec releases this year as well.

The tarball for this release is available from <https://rakudo.org/files/rakudo>.

Please note: This announcement is not for the Rakudo Star
distribution[^2] — it’s announcing a new release of the compiler
only. For the latest Rakudo Star release, see
<https://rakudo.org/files/star>.

The changes in this release are outlined below:

     \
      More specifically:
      + Refactored Scalar and numerous container operations, resulting
          in Scalar being one attribute smaller and paving the way for
          a range of new optimizations
      + As part of the Scalar changes, also extensively refactored
          auto-vivification to be cheaper and more optimizable
      + Implemented specializer plugin for type-check elimination for
          assignments
      + Refactored the way return value handling is done, to generate a
          shorter code sequence
      + Improved the code generated for signature binding so as not to
          repeatedly decontainerize passed values, but rather to only do
          this once
      + Avoided a number of exceptions that could be thrown and caught in
          the optimizer, for a small performance win
      + Avoided a number of situations where parts of the compiler were
          repossessed for serialization purposes, resulting in smaller
          precompilation output
      + Tuned Map and Hash for better lookup and assignment
          performance, as well as more compact code in numerous other
          operations; this made it possible for single-element hash
          access to be fully inlined
      + Tuned Array.AT-POS to enable it to be fully inlined
      + Tuned Array.ASSIGN-POS to do less work
      + Improved `p6bindattrinvres` code-gen quality, which is a slight
          improvement for the many places in CORE.setting that use it
      + Made sure references to the Scalar type-objects compile into a
          constant, not a lexical lookup
  + Internal:
    + Implemented `Perl6::World.lang-ver-before` for easier language
        version check [4dcf5929]
    + Removed `Set`, `Bag`, `Mix` `.clone` special casing [7865bfa6]
    + Updated makeUNIPROP.pl6 with Unicode 10 property names [2ff46764]
    + Removed propname → propname mapping from Cool.pm6 [a9e844a8]
    + Made `infix:<!=>` for `Ints` consistent with other infix
        operators [46e7640f]
    + Simplified `Hash` → `Map` coercion [c567af73]
    + `PseudoStash` "pseudoers" hash is now a native hash [8a8ce95e]
    + Various `Range` internal changes [6ad096c8][806752fb]
    + Tightened up some `trait_mod:<is>` signatures [f6209d73]
    + Renamed nqp::getstrfromname to nqp::strfromname [4522132d]
    + Changed install-dist.p6 to use and prefer full namespace for
        builder identifier [0249afc2]
    + Turned p6reprname into a desugar [07cfbeb2]

[^2]: What’s the difference between the Rakudo compiler and the Rakudo
Star distribution?

The Rakudo compiler is a compiler for the Perl 6 language.
Not much more.

The Rakudo Star distribution is the Rakudo compiler plus a selection
of useful Perl 6 modules, a module installer, Perl 6 introductory
documentation, and other software that can be used with the Rakudo
compiler to enhance its utility.
