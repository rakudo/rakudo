# Notes and hints for working with Rakudo NQP and Pod

## Traps for the Raku programmer

+ **DO NOT use '$0' in match results** - The Raku shorthand for a
  match variable '**$0**' doesn't work in NQP. Instead, use **$/[0]**
  for the zeroeth match.  Note the parser will be very confused
  otherwise and it currently cannot point to the error.


+ **DO NOT use 'nqp::say'** - The routine '**say**' is an NQP built-in
  and it does not need the '**nqp::**' prefix. You can sometimes get
  away with using '**nqp::say**' but, when you least expect it, the
  parser will fail without a helpful error message.

+ **DO use 'nqp::die'** - As opposed to '**say**', '**die**' does need
  to be qualified with '**nqp::**'.  If used without the '**nqp::**'
  prefix, you sometimes may get a very unhelpful error message.

+ **BE WARNED about '$\<some-match-var>' inside a sub with a '$/'
  arg** - Use the full syntax for a match variable
  ('**$/\<some-match-var>**') for more reliable (or at least
  self-documenting) results.

+ **BE WARNED about '$\<a-match-var>' versus
  '$\<a-match-var>\*\*1'** - The first form will result in a scalar
  object while the '\*\*' form will result in an array.  Either form
  may be appropriate for the situation, but proper handling will vary
  for each.

+ **BE WARNED about "return if (...)" statements** - Sometimes they
  work and sometimes not. But the failure message is usually good
  enough to find the offending code.

For example, all these failed:

```
return if !nqp::elems(@arr);
return unless nqp::elems(@arr);
```
but this finally worked:

```
if !nqp::elems(@arr) {
    return;
}
```

## Pod compilation overview

Pod is parsed as it is discovered during the parsing phase of each
compilation unit. Each pod object (string, paragraph, block,
configuration, term, heading, item, etc.) is serialized as it is
completed, and that result is a QAST node. The appropriate assembly of
QAST nodes (which have also been marked as a *compile_time_constant*)
are grouped into instances of pod classes as defined in
**src/core/Pod.pm6**.

## Pod block text content handling

Text inside pod blocks that are contents rather than markup is
comprised of intermixed text and formatting code characters. Newlines
and contiguous whitespace may or may not be significant depending upon
the general block type (abbreviated, paragraph, delimited, or
declarator) or block identifier (e.g., *code*, *input*, *output*,
*defn*, *comment*, or *data*).

The content as it is parsed in Grammar.nqp is first broken into
individual characters which are then assigned to one of three token
groups: regular text, text with formatting code, and text that is to
be unchanged from its input form (*code*, *input*, and *output*).

The regular text and intermingled formatted text are then divided into
two more categories: text that will form one or more paragraphs and
text that is part of a table.  Ultimately, each paragraph of text
should be grouped into the @contents array of a single
**Pod::Block::Para**, but not all pod handling per S26 has been fully
implemented.

Some notable, not-yet-implemented (NYI) features (in order of one
dev's TODO list)

1. NYI: %config :numbered aliasing with '#' for paragraph or delimited
   blocks

2. NYI: pod data blocks

3. NYI: formatting code in defn block terms

4. NYI: formatting code in table cells

5. NYI: pod configuration aliasing

6. NYI: formatting code in declarator blocks (not described in S26, but a user-requested feature)

7. NYI: consistent use of the Pod::Block::Para as the leaf parent of all regular text

8. NYI: pod configuration lines

9. NYI: Pod::Ambient class

10. NYI: nested delimited comment blocks

11. NYI: configuration data on continuation lines are not always
    handled correctly

Anyone wanting to work on any of the NYI items please coordinate on
IRC #raku-dev to avoid duplicate efforts.  Most of the items are
being worked on in a generally logical order of need and knowledge
gained during the process of implementing pod features.

## Pod nesting

Complicating work with pod is that pod blocks can be nested, i.e., a
pod block can have pod blocks as children, to any depth.  Necessarily
that applies, in general, to *delimited blocks*. (Other block types
may have single blocks as children, usually as one or two
**Pod::Block::Para**s.)

One consequence of this is that a pod block with children cannot be
created until all its children have been created.  Another consequence
is that a pod block can have several parts, some of which cannot be
created until child components are analyzed or created.

## Pod block parts

A pod block can have several parts, all of which must be created
before the block itself can be created.  Those parts are:

* Configuration - `%.config` [all blocks inheriting from class **Pod::Block**]

  * The configuration cannot be created until the block text data are analyzed.

  * Note that *abbreviated* blocks cannot have an explicit configuration
section, but they may have limited implicit configuration data through
use of *:numbered aliasing* (see below).

* Contents - `@.contents` [all blocks inheriting from class **Pod::Block**]

  * The contents cannot be created until all child blocks are created.

* Term - `$.term` [*defn* blocks]

  * The term cannot be created until the block text data are analyzed.

* Caption - `$.caption` [*table* blocks]

  * The caption cannot be created until the configuration is analyzed.

* Headers - `@.headers` [*table* blocks]

  * The headers cannot be created until the block text data are analyzed.

## The <pod_textcontent> token

The token **pod_textcontent** is the match object for regular text and
formatted code as described above. It is the source of the final
contents object for regular text containers except for the table
blocks which will be discussed separately. It has a corresponding
action method.

Tracing the pod class building code is tedious and not well
documented. Tokens in the grammar are often made early, along with
other objects, and attached to that token's match object's .ast
attribute which is then used later in another object.  The developer
who wants to change the called .ast code in that other object (which
may be in the grammar, actions, or src/Perl6/Pod.nqp) has to refer
back to the original make point to see its format before doing any
changes--not fun!  There is an ongoing effort to better document the
process for later developers.

Following is the start of a table to show the grammar tokens that have
action methods and their resulting `.ast` values.

| Actions method           | `made` (`ast`) value 
| ---                      | ---            
| pod_textcontent          | 
| pod_block:sym\<delimited> | QAST node [instance of Pod::Heading] 
| pod_block:sym\<delimited> | QAST node [instance of Pod::Item] 
| pod_block:sym\<delimited> | QAST node [instance of Pod::Defn] 
| pod_block:sym\<delimited> | QAST node [instance of Pod::Block::Named] 
| pod_content:sym\<block>   | $<pod_block>.ast;
| pod_content_toplevel     | $<pod_block>.ast

## :numbered aliasing

S26 allows for the '#' character (Unicode name **NUMBER SIGN**), as
the first word in a block, to turn on the **:numbered** %config key;
in that case the '#' will be removed from the data.  The user can
allow a '#' to be recognized as data by either (1) setting the %config
numbered key to false, typically with the **:!numbered** form, or (2)
using the **V** formatting code around the '#' in the data like this:
**V<#>**.

Proper handling of this feature requires changing the block's %config
hash after the block data have been parsed or possibly changing the
parsing of the first block data word due to the presence of
**:!numbered** in the %config hash. Another problem is how to handle
duplicate or incompatible %config keys and values.

The easiest case to handle is the abbreviated block which cannot have
explicit %config data and for which the :numbered alias is most
useful. Examples of the abbreviated blocks most likely to use this
option are the **=item**, **=head**, and **=defn** types.

The '#' turns on the **:numbered** configuration in all these cases:

```
=item # foo bar

=item #
foo bar

=item
#
foo bar
```

Following are examples of situations in other block types that are
not good practice but have to be handled gracefully:

```
=for para :!numbered
# foo bar
```

The **:!numbered** is interpreted to mean accepting the '#' as part of
block data.

```
=for para :numbered
# foo bar
```

The '#' means the same as the **:numbered** option: the renderer
should number the paragraph and the two **:numbered** keys (one
explict and one implicit) are redundant.
