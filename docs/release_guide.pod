=head1 release_guide.pod - guide to Rakudo releases

Rakudo's development release cycle is based on Parrot's release
cycle.  Parrot releases the third Tuesday of each month; Rakudo
will generally issue its own development release two days after
the Parrot release.

Each development release is given a sequential number and a 
code name based on an active Perl Mongers group.  Rakudo's
February 2009 release is #14; prior releases were bundled as
part of monthly Parrot releases.

=head2 Suggested .pm group names for future releases

  Atlanta.pm (* check with Pm before using this one)
  BristolBath.pm
  Milan.pm

More names can be gotten from L<http://www.pm.org> if you 
can't think of one with any particular significance to Perl 
6 or Rakudo

=head2 Steps to create a release (for release managers)

Each Rakudo development release is timed to occur two
days after a Parrot monthly release.

=over 4

=item 1.

A few days before the Parrot release, it's a good idea to:

=over 4

=item *

Remind people of the upcoming release, invite people to
update the ChangeLog file, update the ROADMAP, choose a
release name, etc.

=item *

Verify that the Parrot trunk head is able to build Rakudo
and run the spectest suite. Also check the smolder reports
at L<http://tinyurl.com/rakudosmoke>.

=item *

If Parrot's trunk exhibits any problems building or running
Rakudo (that require changes to Parrot to fix), immediately
report them to the Parrot development team so they can be
fixed prior to Parrot's release.

=item *

Review the RT queue for tickets that might need resolving
prior to the release, addressing them as needed.  "Tickets
that need resolving" is left your discretion.  Any problem
that has a large impact on users is worth addressing either
as a fix or as prominent documentation (the README and/or
the release announcement).

=back

=item 2.

Once Parrot issues its monthly release, edit Rakudo's
build/PARROT_REVISION file to contain the subversion revision
number and release number corresponding to Parrot's monthly
release.  For example, for June 2009 PARROT_REVISION file
contained "39599 1.3.0".  As always, test to make sure Rakudo
still builds and passes its tests.  Once build/PARROT_REVISION
has been set to the Parrot release, it must not be changed until
after the Rakudo release.  In other words, we want each
monthly release of Rakudo to be able to be built using
the immediately prior release of Parrot.

=item 3.

The short period following the Parrot release until the
Rakudo release is generally intended for fixing bugs,
updating documentation, and so on.

=item 4.

As the actual release date nears, review the git log history
to see if any additional items need to be added to the ChangeLog.
This can be conveniently done with  "git log --since=yyyy-mm-dd --reverse".

  $ git commit docs/ChangeLog

=item 5.

When it's time to cut the release, create a new release announcement
in docs/announce/YYYY.MM.  It's often a good idea to use the
previous month's file as a starting point for this.  Highlight areas
in which the new release is significant.  If possible, also give
some small details about the choice of release name.  (If the
details are a bit lengthy, this can often best be done as a separate
section at the bottom of the announcement.)

The release announcement has a bullet for passing spectests and the
percentage of the available spectest suite that's passing.  To get
the number of available tests, look at "docs/spectest-progress.csv".
If it hasn't been updated recently, use "git log docs/spectest-progress.csv"
to find out who has been updating it and seek out this person for an
update. You can also run F<tools/test_summary.pl> to obtain the latest data.
To get the total number of available spectests, the tool C<ack> (see
L<http://search.cpan.org/dist/ack/>) has to be installed and be found in
C<$PATH>.

As of this writing, there's not a publicly available tool to
update spectest-progress.csv or to count tests that won't run.

  $ git add docs/announce/YYYY.MM
  $ git commit docs

=item 6.

Update the release dates and names at the top of this file
(F<docs/release_guide.pod>).  Also improve these instructions if
you find any steps that are missing.

  $ git commit docs/release_guide.pod

=item 7.

Make sure everything compiles and runs from a known clean state:

  $ make realclean
  $ perl Configure.pl --gen-parrot
  $ make
  $ make test
  $ make spectest

Continue adjusting things until make spectest passes as expected.
Often this means fixing a bug, fudging a test, or (temporarily?)
commenting out a test file in t/spectest.data .  Use your best 
judgment or ask others if uncertain what to do here.

=item 8.

Make sure any locally modified files have been pushed back to github.

  $ git status
  $ git push

=item 9.

Create an initial tarball by entering C<make release VERSION=YYYY.MM>,
where YYYY-MM is the month for which the release is being made.
This will create a candidate tarball file named <rakudo-YYYY.MM.tgz>.

=item 10.

Unpack the tar file into another area, and test that it
builds and runs properly.  If there are any problems,
fix them and go back to step 7.

=item 11.

Tag the release by its release month ("MMMM.YY") and its code name.

  $ git tag -a -m"tag release #nn" MMMM.YY    # e.g., 2010.02
  $ git tag -a -m"tag release #nn" CODENAME   # e.g., "Bratislava"
  $ git push --tags

=item 12.

Upload the release tarball to github's download area at
L<http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads>.

=item 13.

Publish the release announcement (from #5) above to appropriate
locations, including rakudo.org, use.perl, perl6-language,
perl6-announce, perl6-users, and others.

=item 14.

Update the Wikipedia entry at L<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakudo>.

=item 15.

Promote the release anywhere else you think appropriate.

=item 16.

You're done!  Celebrate with the appropriate amount of fun.
