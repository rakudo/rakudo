# IterationBuffer is used when the list/iteration implementation needs a
# lightweight way to store/transmit values. Replaces the use of nqp::list in
# the list guts, which is an impediment to introspectability and also to
# allowing the implementation of custom iterators (though in reality most
# folks won't implement Iterator directly, but instead use gather/take or lazy
# loops). It doesn't make Scalar containers, and only supports mutation
# through implementing push and BIND-POS, and access by implementing AT-POS.
# Hot-paths are free to use the nqp:: op set directly on this, and do things
# outside the scope of the method API it exposes. This type is engineered for
# performance over friendliness, and should not be encountered in normal use
# of Raku. Do NOT add any checks and validation to methods in here. They
# need to remain trivially inlineable for performance reasons.
