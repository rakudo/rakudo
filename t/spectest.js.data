# This is a list of all spec tests that are expected to pass.
#
# Empty lines and those beginning with a # are ignored
#
# We intend to include *all* tests from roast, even when we
# skip most of the tests or the entire test file. To verify
# we are running all tests, run:
#
# perl tools/update-passing-test-data.pl
#
# If a file appears in the output of the script, it is not run
# by default. It may need to be fudged in order to run successfully.
# Open an RT when necessary as part of the fudge process, using the
# RT in the fudge message, and then add the test file to this file, sorted.
#
# Each file may have one or more markers that deselects the test:
#     long   - run tests unless --quick
#     stress - run tests only if --stress
#     moar   - run tests only for MoarVM backend
# See the "make quicktest" and "make stresstest" targets in
# build/Makefile.in for examples of use.
