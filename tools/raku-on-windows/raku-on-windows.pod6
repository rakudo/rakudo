=head2 Step 1. Remove prior installation(s)

If there exists a prior installation of Perl 6 / Raku on your
computer, remove it.  Current installers are not adept at removing
prior installations so it is recommended to remove them manually.

Go into the B<Control Panel, Programs and Features>, and remove prior installations

=begin code
<ctrl><R> AppWiz.cpl
=end code

=head2 Step 2. Install dependencies

Windows installers do not come with a "spec file" to automatically
download and install dependencies as does Linux packages, such as
'dnf/rpm'.  If not included in the installer, it is up to the user to
figure them out on his own.  Perl 6 / Raku comes with such a dependency
for 'git', which is required to comfortably install packages with
the Raku module installer 'zef'.

To install "git", go to

 L<https://git-for-windows.github.io>

and scroll down from the top.

Note: to add git's UNIX (Linux) tools (ls, tar, curl, etc.)
      to the path.  Accept all the other defaults.

1. inside the installer, on the
   + Adjust your PATH environment (window name at top)
         - Use Git and optional Unix tools from the Command
         Prompt (bottom selection)

=begin code
2) Or, after the fact:
   --> <win><r> sysdm.cpl
     --> Advanced (tab at the top)
      --> Environmental Variables (button, lower right)
       --> Path, Edit, add to the end
                ;C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin
=end code

Note: any command terminals opened before the installation will have to be reopened to update the path to the Git commands.
